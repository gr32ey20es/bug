# Process

    Two days of real bug hunting and practicing on HackTheBox yielded no results (understood nothing). 
    Then, spent three days for PortSwigger (very similar to CS155 but... it's somewhat harder...)

    Needless to say, web security is so boring. I don't know, it's all about injecting and finding policy violations. Maybe the only interesting part is about logic vulnerabilities, which I don't know how to deal with. I changed my focus toward binary exploitation, but it requires much deeper knowledge about compilers, operating systems, file types, etc. It raped my mind :). So anxious!!!
    It took me nearly five days just to find a good "enough" path, so I ended up with CVE documentation :).
    Then, my mind got raped twice in just one week :))).
